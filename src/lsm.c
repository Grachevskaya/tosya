 * lsm.c - watch a task's identity change where the kernel commits it.
 *
 * The id setters used to be hooked in the syscall table: six entries per table,
 * and a wrapper that had to sample the fsuid before and after the call to see
 * what had happened. The kernel already has the exact place for that -- the LSM
 * hook the setuid family calls with both creds in hand -- and taking it costs one
 * indirect call on a path that is doing real work anyway.
 *
 * Registration is the shape KernelSU uses. The hook heads are resolved by name,
 * because they are not exported; the entry already sitting in a head has its
 * function pointer replaced by this module's, which runs first and calls what it
 * replaced. Nothing is added to or taken out of a list an LSM registered, so the
 * shape of every hook list is left exactly as it was, and unloading puts the
 * pointer back.
 *
 * Only the setuid hook is taken. The gid setters ran the same code, but a gid
 * change does not move the fsuid, so that path only ever saw a value that had not
 * changed and had nothing to record.
